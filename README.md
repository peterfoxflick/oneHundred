A SwiftUI iOS app using CoreData for tracking goals.

## The Goal
Being inspired by the [100 Day Journal](https://www.amazon.com/100-Day-Goal-Journal-Accomplish-Matters/dp/1454930748) I wanted to make a more portable version. This was my first major undertaking in iOS development with my only previous mobile app experience being my [Emoji App.](https://github.com/peterfoxflick/Messji)

## The Process
Because everything worth learning comes with a horrendous learning curve, I used this project as my Senior Project to help motivate me past the finish line. The goals were simple, an app that could track 100 day goals, have daily todo items, and allow users to reflect on each day. I ended up taking it a bit further my allowing users to customize what their daily refelctions could be about. 

## Lesson Learned
When I started this project, SwiftUI was still fairly new, and as such not a lot of learning resources existed. As such I did find 1 usefull Udemy course that used CoreData with SwiftUi and this gave me just enough code to see how MVVM worked with CoreData. I used this as a springboard to create the OneHundred Day app.
